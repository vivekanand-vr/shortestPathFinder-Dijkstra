# Description :
The project is a shortest path finder that uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph.

The project is built using React, which is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

The user can create a custom graph by clicking on the cells in the grid. The cells represent nodes in the graph, and the user can add edges between them by clicking and dragging between cells.

The user can choose a start and end node, and the algorithm will find the shortest path between them. The shortest path is highlighted on the grid, and the length of the path is displayed on the screen.

The project includes a responsive and user-friendly interface that allows the user to interact with the graph and the algorithm. The interface includes buttons for creating and clearing the graph, choosing the start and end nodes, and running the algorithm.
